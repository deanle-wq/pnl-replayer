# Building on Birdeye Data: what this repo is for

PnL Replayer is a reference build. Fork it to ship a wallet PnL board, a ledger
audit or a shareable PnL video on the Birdeye Data API. This page covers what
Birdeye Data handles for you, what it costs and where to extend it.

## What Birdeye Data handles for you

| Concern | Building from raw on-chain transactions | With Birdeye Data | What a builder saves |
|---|---|---|---|
| Price candles | Pick a pool, page its swaps and price each bar yourself: thousands of reads per chart window | `GET /defi/v3/ohlcv`: one request per 5,000 candles, 1m to 1D | The hardest subsystem disappears |
| Trader discovery | Scan holders, then read every wallet's full history before you can rank anyone | Top Traders × 6 ranking lenses + Wallet PnL Multiple (WAC) | A ranked board in seconds |
| One wallet's fills | Decode every venue's instructions, price from pool balance deltas, convert SOL to USD with an outside feed | Wallet Balance Change (quantity) joined to Token Transactions V3 with `owner` (USD-priced) by signature | No decoders, no price feed |
| PnL accounting | Write a ledger from scratch | Birdeye WAC baseline, plus this repo's conservative ledger with a confidence grade | Fast path and audit path from one provider |
| Wallet names | Maintain your own label set | `POST /identity/v1/multiple` (not wired yet) | See "Extend" |
| Wallet-first entry | Enumerate a wallet's token accounts | `POST /wallet/v2/pnl/details` (phase 2) | See "Extend" |
| Cost visibility | Count your own calls | Per-request CU meter built into the UI and the CLI | Cost is visible from the first call |
| Video | Screenshot a charting library and layer DOM labels | One pure canvas renderer shared by preview and export, sound mixed in, 5–300 s, 16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1 at 1080p | The exported frames match the preview exactly |

## Measured cost

BONK, measured with the in-app meter (board 2026-10-09, audit 2026-10-08). CU
values come from Birdeye's
[published compute-unit table](https://data.birdeye.so/docs/guides/what-is-compute-unit-cost.md).

| Step | Requests | CU |
|---|---:|---:|
| Board (6 Top Traders lenses, Wallet PnL Multiple, OHLCV, price, metadata, market data) | 12 | 894 |
| Ledger audit of the leading wallet (17 balance-change pages, 48 trade buckets, OHLCV) | 66 | 821 |
| **One full analysis** | **78** | **1,715** |

Opening a wallet's video builds its full ledger. A 68-trade wallet took
32 requests, 389 CU and about 6 s (`npm run audit -- <mint> <wallet>` prints
the same breakdown in a terminal). The modal prints each replay's requests and
CU.

Prices used by the meter:

| Endpoint | CU |
|---|---|
| `/defi/v2/tokens/top_traders` | 30 |
| `/wallet/v2/pnl/multiple` | ceil(30 × wallets^0.8) |
| `/wallet/v2/balance-change` | 10 |
| `/defi/v3/token/txs` | 12 |
| `/defi/v3/ohlcv` | 25 / 30 / 40 / 75 / 100 by candles returned |
| `/defi/price`, `/defi/v3/token/meta-data/single` | 3 |

## Endpoint traps (verified live)

- Token Transactions V3 with `owner` and **no** time bounds returns zero rows
  on a busy token. Bounds are required, and their span is capped at 30 days.
  Read 29-day buckets, and only those that contain a balance change.
- `tx_type=buy` and `tx_type=sell` filter by side together with `owner`. The
  sampled replay reads one page of each, so buys never crowd out sells.
- Top Traders `firstTradeUnixTime` is not scoped to the token. One BONK wallet
  reported a first trade three months before BONK existed. Clamp it to the
  token's chart before using it.
- Wallet PnL Multiple can omit a wallet entirely. A missing row means "not
  answered", not $0.

## Extend

Ordered by value for a demo. Item 1 is planned for phase 2.

1. **Wallet-first entry (phase 2).** Paste a wallet; `POST /wallet/v2/pnl/details` (30 CU)
   lists the tokens it traded with PnL. Pick one and open the video directly.
2. **Wallet names.** Batch the board through `/identity/v1/multiple`
   (ceil(30 × n^0.8) CU, up to 100 addresses; needs a Premium plan) and show
   exchange and KOL labels.
3. **Market-cap axis.** Multiply candles by the circulating supply the board
   already reads from Token Market Data (the card's Entry MC does this for
   one number). Meme traders read "$1.2M MC" faster than a sub-cent price.
4. **Production guards.** Use a shared cache, a job queue for heavy wallets,
   and CU ceilings per IP, per wallet and per day, with a pre-flight cost
   check before expensive work.
5. **Voice-over.** Browser speech synthesis cannot be captured into the
   export. A narrated result card needs a server-side TTS call mixed into the
   soundtrack buffer.

## Design system

- **Brand.** The Birdeye Data brand kit is copied in unchanged:
  `src/styles/birdeye-data-tokens.css`, Geist and Geist Mono in
  `public/brand/fonts`, logos in `public/brand/logos`. The app uses the
  terminal profile: black ground, 1px borders, no drop shadows, and green
  only as an accent.
- **Components.** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) on Radix: Dialog, Tabs,
  ToggleGroup, Switch, Slider, Tooltip, Button, Badge and Input. Its theme
  variables map onto the Birdeye tokens in `globals.css`, and every shadow
  token is set to none.
- **Icons.** [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com).
- **Video.** Follows the social-channel rules: Geist only, with the corner
  glow, grain and glass chips of the campaign art. Red appears only for losses
  and sells, always paired with a sign, a label, or a B/S badge.

## Video architecture

| Module | Job |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/video-scene.ts` | Pure timing: timeline, fill bursts, popups, sound cues, number formats. Unit tested |
| `src/lib/video-frame.ts` | `drawVideoFrame(ctx, seconds, scene)`, which draws one frame. Preview and export call the same function |
| `src/lib/video-audio.ts` | Synthesised sound effects. The same graph runs live (`AudioContext`) and offline (`OfflineAudioContext`) |
| `src/lib/wallet-video.ts` | Frame-by-frame mediabunny export with an AAC or Opus track |
| `src/lib/replay-window.ts` | The wallet's own chart window, and bar placement that never drops a fill |
| `src/lib/wallet-tags.ts` | Card vocabulary: invested, entry market cap, sold, the multiple and achievement tags. Unit tested |
| `src/lib/token-logo.ts` | Loads the token logo with CORS (direct, then an image proxy) so the canvas stays exportable |
